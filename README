Flake is a light-weight archtitectural and applicative micro-framework, designed at first to work with a rails REST amf3 based backend application. In fact, it probably should work with any RESTful backend application. Although I use it in light production projects, you should not use flake at this time, because it's not fully tested. When I'll have some free-time, I'll test-drive a full refactoring.
